This repository holds my Parallella experiment projects.

There are the following projects in the repository:

## helloCores: 
runs one core after another each printing a short Hello message

## helloCoresII: 
runs 4 x four cores in parallel each writing a different message

## simpleCoreCommunication: 
runs 4 cores. Each write a number to a local variable with the help of the barrier() they synchronize and then read a variable from another core using pointers
